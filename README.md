### Known bugs

* Sometimes ``peerflix`` fails to launch my player, I'm not sure why, but in this case I just re-run ``show-time --no-player`` and run manually my player to stream ``http://localhost:8888``

## How it works

* ``show-time`` grabs your RSS feed from showrss.info to show a list of recently available episodes
* It will then search on opensubtitles.org for subtitles (results cached for 1 hour)
* Once the torrent magnet and the subtitles grabbed, it runs ``peerflix`` to download and play video

## The cache

A lot of things are put in the cache, which is located at ``$HOME/.show-time/cache``:

* The downloaded torrents
* OpenSubtitles results (.json)
* Subtitles (.srt)

You can remove files manually, or you can empty the whole cache with ``show-time --clear-cache``

## Roadmap

* Add configuration options
* Add support for chromecast
